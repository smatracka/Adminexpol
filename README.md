## Development Setup

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) if you don't already have it.
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you don't already have it.
- [Clone the repository.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
- Open up a terminal / command prompt in the project directory, and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to start up a live-reloading development web server.

When pulling changes from git, run `npm install` again in case there are any new or updated dependencies.
(If you know `package-lock.json` hasn't changed, you shouldn't need to do this.)

Some dependencies are versioned with npm, but pulled into the repo with `npm run pull-libs`

To update subrepos, or push changes to them, install [git-subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo). You don't need this tool to clone the project and get up and running, as subrepos are just normal subdirectories with a `.gitrepo` metadata file.
Note that the metadata file references specific commit hashes, including between repositories, so it's best to avoid rebasing when subrepo updates are involved, i.e. once you do a subrepo command, it makes a commit, and should leave it (and earlier commits) alone, and you should leave commits in the subrepo alone, before and up to any commits referenced by the containing project.
I'd recommend phrasing commit messages to apply to the subrepo, primarily, rather than the containing project.
If you so much as edit the commit message for a `git subrepo push`ed commit, you'd have to update the `.gitrepo` metadata file manually,
OR you could drop the commit you pushed and the `git subrepo push` commit (which updates the metadata) and do `git subrepo pull` instead (which btw gives you an option to rename the commit; and I think renaming that commit would be safe after the fact anyways as long as it's the last commit and not pushed).
